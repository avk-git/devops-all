Refer: listjobs.bat

Create the above file in the same directory as jenkins.war (filename: listjobs.bat)
Go to the directory, execute it in 
	windows
		listjobs.bat
	linux
		sh listjobs.sh
		
	N.B: CLI would work from any folder where jenkins-cli.jar is present. 
	jenkins.war need not be present there.
